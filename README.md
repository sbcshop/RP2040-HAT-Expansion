## Setup RP2040 HAT Expansion 
### It Support C/C++, MicroPython and circuitpython
1. Download Thonny IDE 

   https://thonny.org/

2. In RP2040 HAT Expansion we can use both MicroPython and CircuitPython, but we use micropython ( **use micropython** * )
   * Install **Micropython** in RP2040 HAT Expansion
     first you need to press the boot button of RP2040 HAT Expansion, then connect the USB, don,t release the button until you connect the USB to the laptop. then you see a new        device named "RPI-RP2".

     After this go to run->select interpreter,choose device,port and install micropython (install firmware)

   * Install **CircuitPython** in RP2040 HAT Expansion
     Insert the circuit python to the PiSquare(it is circuit python firmware "adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-7.1.1.uf2"). for this first you need to        press the boot button then connect the USB, don,t release the button until you connect the USB to the laptop. then you see a new device named "RPI-RP2" drag this      file "adafruit-circuitpython- raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-7.1.1.uf2" to this device as shown in figure:
     this is the official website, or you can download from here https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/

     When you properly insert the circuitpython then you see a new device that looks like the below image:-

      After this go to run->select interpreter,choose device and port
