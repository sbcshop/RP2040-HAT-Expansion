## Parts specification
1.**RP2040 Microcontroller IC**
   * Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz
   * Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus (External flash W25Q16JVSNIQ)
   * 264kB on-chip SRAM in six independent banks
   * On-chip programmable LDO to generate the core voltage
   * 2 on-chip PLLs to generate USB and core clocks
  
2. **Status Led**
   * Status led is connected to **GP24** Pin of PiSquare

3. **Two push buttons**
   * Reset button     (Reset pisquare)
   * Boot button      (Boot button of RP2040)

## Setup RP2040 HAT Expansion 
### It Support C/C++, MicroPython and circuitpython
1. Download Thonny IDE 

   https://thonny.org/

2. In RP2040 HAT Expansion we can use both MicroPython and CircuitPython, but we use micropython ( **use micropython** * )
   * Install **Micropython** in RP2040 HAT Expansion
     first you need to press the boot button of RP2040 HAT Expansion, then connect the USB, don,t release the button until you connect the USB to the laptop. then you see a new        device named "RPI-RP2".

     After this go to run->select interpreter,choose device,port and install micropython (install firmware)

   * Install **CircuitPython** in RP2040 HAT Expansion
     Insert the circuit python to the PiSquare(it is circuit python firmware "adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-7.1.1.uf2"). for this first you need to        press the boot button then connect the USB, don,t release the button until you connect the USB to the laptop. then you see a new device named "RPI-RP2" drag this      file "adafruit-circuitpython- raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-7.1.1.uf2" to this device as shown in figure:
     this is the official website, or you can download from here https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/

     When you properly insert the circuitpython then you see a new device that looks like the below image:-

      After this go to run->select interpreter,choose device and port
